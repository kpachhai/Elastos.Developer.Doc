# Elephant App Protocol

Version：1.0

## Introduction

Based on this protocol, third party payment and verification of DID identity can be supported.
Third parties include: Web, Html5 App, Android App and iOS App.

## Features

### Request Identity

When a third party app needs personal DID identity of users, it can initiate a request to the Elephant App, and the user will get authenticated by the Elephant app and authorized to return some information to the third party.
A typical use case is to log in:

- Step 1：Third party generates request content, including requester information and a random number.
- Step 2：After the user gets authorized, it signs the random number and DID information, and send a call back to the third party.
- Step 3：The third party verifies the response content. Elephant app will jump to the third-party specified return page.

### Request Payment

When a third-party application needs to pay using a crypto token, it can initiate a request to the Elephant App, and the user can authorize the Elephant App to make the payment on their behalf similar to Alipay and Paypal.

- Step 1：Third party initiates a request, including payment content, amount, currency, and order unique identifier.
- Step 2：Elephant app starts with the transfer payment page and soon after, the user is authorized and it initiates the transfer and returns TXID to the third party.
- Step 3：The third party queries the node interface for the status of the transaction with the TXID.

### 3. Generate AppId

#### Step 1, Generate developer Did

Generate Did for developer.

#### Step 2, Register developer Did

Write the developer public key to id chain, key is "PublicKey".

#### Step 3, Generate AppId

Give an app name, for example: org.elastos.app.wallet.

Sign the app name by developer private key. AppId = sign(privateKey, {AppName}).

Write the AppId to id chain, key is "Apps/{AppName}/AppId".

#### AppId tool

You may generate AppId by this tool.
